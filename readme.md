PYTHON TESTS

This is my coding exercise results following lessons I took from JOSE SALVATIERRA'S AUTOMATED SOFTWARE TESTING WITH PYTHON in UDEMY.

The tests include several examples for Testing Pyramid: unit tests, integration tests and system tests.

UNITTEST

The python tests are created using Python's UNITTEST library.

APPLICATIONS

There are two apps to test:

- a blog app with simple functions to create, read and post contents on a blog.

- a flask app that displays a json response Hello World.
