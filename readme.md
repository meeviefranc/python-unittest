PYTHON UNIT TEST

This is my coding exercise results following lessons I took from JOSE SALVATIERRA'S AUTOMATED SOFTWARE TESTING WITH PYTHON in UDEMY.

The app to test is a blog app with simple functions to create, read and post contents on a blog.

The python tests are created using Python's UNITTEST library.

The tests were designed to follow the Testing Pyramid: unit tests, integration tests and system tests.
